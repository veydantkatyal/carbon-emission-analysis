# Carbon Emissions Impact Analysis

This project analyzes global carbon emissions using Python, helping uncover trends and insights related to climate change. The dataset contains country-wise CO₂ emissions data over time, which is explored and visualized to understand the environmental impact.

---

## Project Overview

The aim of this project is to:

- Analyze global CO₂ emissions data
- Visualize emissions trends over time
- Identify the top contributors to carbon emissions
- Explore year-wise and country-wise patterns
- Raise awareness about environmental sustainability through data-driven insights

---

## Technologies Used

- **Python** 
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** 
- **Jupyter Notebook** 

---

## Dataset
Check out the dataset from:
1. `carbon_emmission.csv` One containing annual temperature changes across multiple countries and decades,
2. `temperature.csv`Another featuring monthly CO₂ concentrations measured globally.
Combine these datasets
